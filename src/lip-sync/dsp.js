/**
 * LipSyncDsp — EMA smoothing + decaying-peak AGC + voicing gate.
 *
 * This is a port of the DESKTOP player's TTS path
 * (`ania_player/plugins/voice_assistant/voice_bridge.py`, `on_tts_chunk` +
 * `_detect_speech`). The desktop is fed one audio block every ~30 ms, so every
 * constant there is expressed PER BLOCK. The web has no such luxury: we are
 * polled from `requestAnimationFrame`, which is 60 Hz on most machines, 120 Hz
 * on a high-refresh laptop, and 0 Hz in a background tab.
 *
 * Hard-coding the per-block constants would therefore make the avatar behave
 * differently on a 120 Hz display than on a 60 Hz one — a bug that is nearly
 * impossible to reproduce in the field, because the reporter's hardware is the
 * variable. So every constant below is re-derived from `dt` on each call:
 *
 *   EMA   `s = 0.6a + 0.4s` per 30 ms  ->  retention 0.4 per 30 ms
 *                                          half-life = 30*ln(0.5)/ln(0.4)  = 22.7 ms
 *   AGC   `peak *= 0.995`     per 30 ms  ->  half-life = 30*ln(0.5)/ln(0.995) = 4149 ms
 *   gate open   `> 1 block`  @30 ms  ->  60 ms
 *   gate close  `> 5 blocks` @30 ms  ->  180 ms
 *
 * Nothing in this file reads a clock or a random number: `dtMs` is injected by
 * the caller. That is the whole reason this module is testable under plain
 * `node` (see `examples/test-lip-dsp.mjs`).
 */

/**
 * Upper bound on a single `dt`, in ms.
 *
 * The caller measures `dt` from `performance.now()` inside the rAF poll. A tab
 * that was frozen (backgrounded, laptop lid closed, a long synchronous task)
 * hands us a `dt` of seconds. Without this clamp, ONE such call would decay the
 * AGC peak straight down to its 0.05 floor, and the next quiet syllable would
 * normalise to 1.0 — i.e. the mouth slams wide open on a quiet phrase ending.
 * That is exactly the regression the desktop's `0.995` comment documents (it
 * happened there with the older, faster `0.97` decay), and it is worth
 * repeating: a slow decay is only slow if no single step is allowed to be huge.
